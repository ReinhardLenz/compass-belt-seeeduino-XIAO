# **Circuit Documentation**

## **Summary**

This circuit is designed to control multiple coin vibration motors using a Seeeduino XIAO microcontroller, an MCP23S17 I/O expander, and two ULN2803 Darlington Arrays. The circuit also includes a BNO085 sensor for motion detection and a push button for user input. The Seeeduino XIAO communicates with the MCP23S17 via SPI, which in turn controls the ULN2803 arrays to drive the vibration motors. The BNO085 sensor is connected via I2C to the Seeeduino XIAO.
